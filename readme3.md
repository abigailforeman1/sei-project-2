# General Assembly Project 2: The Cocktail Club

## Goal:
To build a React application that consumes a public API.

## Timeframe:
48 hours 

## Technologies used:
* React.js
* https://www.thecocktaildb.com
* Bulma
* Github

## Deployment: 
This game has been deployed on Heroku and can be found here: the-cocktail-club.herokuapp.com/

## Getting started: 
Use the clone button to download the game source code. From the root directory type 'npm run serve' in the terminal then navigate to localhost:4000 in your browser.

## Brief: 
For this project we had to build a React application that consumed a public API, incorporated at least one classical and one functional component, included a router with several "pages", included wireframes that we designed before building, have semantically clean HTML and be deployed online and accessible to the public.

This was my second project while on General Assemblyâ€™s SEI course and also my first project building with React and APIs.

## Game architecture:
The player controls the spaceship (Lisa Simpson) and can move along the bottom row of the grid from left to right. The player can also shoot towards the invading Bart aliens by pressing the spacebar which sends a bullet up that specific column of the grid. If the bullet hits one of the Bart aliens it removes it from the grid. 

The 3 rows of invading Bart aliens are programmed to move automatically once the game starts. They move from left to right and down a row each time they reach the side of the grid. A random alien will also drop a bomb every 2 seconds which falls down towards the player. If the player is hit the game ends. If the player shoots a bullet and it collides with the bomb, both items are removed from the grid and the game continues. 

If the player manages to destroy all the invading Bart aliens then the game restarts but their score remains so they can keep playing. Once the game ends, a modal popup appears displaying the players score. This also gets added to the leaderboard from local storage.

Here are examples of my code that controls the aliens movement and fires the players bullet if the column doesn't already contain a bullet:

```
  function moveAliens() {
    removeAliens()

    if (direction === 1 && aliens[0] % width === 3) {
      direction = width
    } else if (direction === width && aliens[0] % width === 3) {
      direction = -1
    } else if (direction === -1 && aliens[0] % width === 0) {
      direction = width
    } else if (direction === width && aliens[0] % width === 0) {
      direction = 1
    } else if (aliens[0] > (width * width) - width) {  
      gameOver()
    }
    addAliens()
  }
```

```
  function shoot() {
  let currentShootIndex = playerIndex - width 
  let newShootIndex = currentShootIndex 
  const columnArray = [] 
  
  for (let i = 1; i < width - 1; i++) {
    columnArray.push(newShootIndex -= 11) 
  }

  const someContainShots = columnArray.some(item => { 
    return squares[item].classList.contains('shoot')
  })

  if (someContainShots === false) {
    squares[currentShootIndex].classList.add('shoot')
    shootTimerId = setInterval(shootMovement, 100) 
  } else {
    console.log('you can\'t shoot!')
  }
```

## Challenges and future improvements:
1. The first challenge I encountered was creating the movement for the aliens. I used an array of numbers corresponding to grid square index numbers to place the aliens, so I had to ensure that the conditions to move them left, right, up and down worked for all aliens.
2. Another challenge was stopping the players shots going through the aliens when more than one was fired up the same column. To fix this issue I wrote a piece of code that checked if a grid in that column already contained a bullet or not.
3. There are a number of future improvements that I plan to make. Firstly, I would like to add functionality for the movement of the aliens to speed up once they have all been destroyed. I would also like to develop the leaderboard with names and everyscore displaying no matter if it was the highest or not.
